        unlimited register machine(further URM).
It has 4 command
The number recorded in the register R_n will be denoted
by r_n contents
1) reset command - Z (n) (n ∈ {1,2,3 ...}).
This command replaces the contents of the register R_n
to 0 without affecting the other registers.
2) increment 1 command - S(n) (n ∈ {1,2,3 ...})
This command increases the value of the register R_n by
1 without affecting other registers.
3) redirect command - T (m, n) (m, n ∈ {1,2,3 ...}).
This command replaces the contents of the register number R_n
r_m, contained in the register R_m without affecting other
registers (including the register R_m)
4)the conditional branch command is J (m, n, q) (m, n, q ∈ {1,2,3 ...}).
Execution of this command is as follows: - Compares the contents of the registers
R_m and R_n,if r_m = r_n the team proceeds to qy team running program; If r_m ≠ r_n
the program proceeds to the next command.If you want to run the command with a number
that exceeds the number of teams in the program, the machine stops working.

Button "Save" -saves code to a specified location
Button "Open" - opens the code from a designated place
Button "Compile" - it compiles the code and checks for errors
Button "Play" -  starts executing  program
Button "Step" - the execution step by step
Button "Stop" - it stops the execution of the program
Button "Reset" - resets all
